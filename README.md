# PM-Dungeon-Framework

## About

The **PM-Dungeon** is a lightweight Java framework for the development of a 2D-Rouge-like game. It is designed for educational purposes and is especially aimed at inexperienced Java developers. The project currently uses the [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) as a backend.

This is the `core` part of the project. It contains the actual framework without any launcher implementation. You can use it to develop your own game, but it is probably easier to use the [dungeon-starter](https://github.com/PM-Dungeon/dungeon-starter) project as a starting point for your own game.

## Requirements

- Java SE Development Kit 17.0.x LTS

## Installing & quick start
